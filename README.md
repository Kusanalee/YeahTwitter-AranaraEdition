# Yeah! for Twitter - aranara edition

Just a mostly lazy rebranding. all this does is replace the pictures with arama from genshin (ala aranara)

Extension that adds a "Yeah!" button to Twitter. Essentially, it's a public Like button. It doesn't send spammy images into replies, instead it saves your Yeahs into a shared database. Everyone can see who Yeahed a tweet, and what tweets person Yeahed.  
This extension supports both new Twitter and OldTwitter!  

### steps to install: 
1. Go to [Releases](https://github.com/Kusanalee/YeahTwitter-AranaraEdition/releases) page.
2. Download `chrome.zip` if you're on Chromium based browsers (Chrome, Edge, Opera, Brave, etc.) or `firefox.zip` if you're on Firefox.

### Chromium (so that's arc, and chrome and opera gx)
- Unpack file anywhere
- Go to `chrome://extensions`
- Turn on Developer mode
- Press "Load unpacked" and select folder with extension.

#### There will be no chrome webstore release for this. It was literally an addon I made before I sleep lol
