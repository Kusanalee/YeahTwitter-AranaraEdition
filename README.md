# Yeah! for Twitter - aranara edition

Just a mostly lazy rebranding. all this does is replace the pictures with arama from genshin (ala aranara)

Extension that adds a "Yeah!" button to Twitter. Essentially, it's a public Like button. It doesn't send spammy images into replies, instead it saves your Yeahs into a shared database. Everyone can see who Yeahed a tweet, and what tweets person Yeahed.  
This extension supports both new Twitter and OldTwitter!  

Userscript (Tampermonkey, Greasemonkey, Violentmonkey, etc):
